# Instagram Clone

I've wanted to build social app clone for a while now and it is finally here. It is not in it's best shape but user can already create new post, create a story, he can add friends, he can search for other users, like other posts. I will definitely keep on adding functionality. As always, backend for the app was built in Spring Boot and frontend in React. Forontend of the app can be found in master branch. All the relevant data was stored in MySql tables which were created by Hibernate.
